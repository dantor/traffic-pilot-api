Example usage:

./generate_request.py 50.11251 8.6875  270 | curl --silent --json @- https://prognose.gevas.eu/frankfurt/ssp-apha/rest/position/v14 | jq

Three (fake) position data sets are required by the server.
Each data set/record contains also speed, distance to previous record and heading, which is redundant to some extend and calculated
by the py script from the provided position of the traffic light and the provided direction the traffic light is facing to.
270 degrees, for example, correspond to traffic approaching the traffic light from the west - or, equivalently, eastbound vehicles heading
toward the traffic light.

Altitude fields can be ignored (=0).
"key" seems to be equal across all clients and may be different for some development devices.
However, "uuid" is client specific but can be set arbitrarily without prior registration or assignment.
The official client replaces its uuid every 30mins for privacy reasons.
For our development/testing/hacking purposes, we should maybe use only one key to keep the option to distinguish (our) fake position data from
real data from users using the official app later on by the operator, since our goal is not to corrupt the collected traffic data which may be used
by official authorities to perform various data analysis and traffic planning and so on.
The purpose of "lsastate" and "value" are unknown at the moment.
